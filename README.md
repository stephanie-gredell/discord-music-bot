# MusicBot for Discord

This is a basic Discord bot that will use the Youtube APi to find videos based on a song title and artist name.

Note: You need to create a Token class with your own Discord Token, Youtube API Key and Spotify API client and secret.

Sample: 

```java

public class Token {
    public static final String TOKEN = "discordToken";
    public static final String YOUTUBE_API_KEY = "YoutubeApiKey";
}

```
